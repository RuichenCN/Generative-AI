3. Inner Monologue

    Since we asked the LLM to separate its reasoning steps by a delimiter, we can hide the chain-of-thought reasoning from the final output that the user sees by 
    - Step 1: removing the the following text from the response
                <delimiter>text<delimiter>
    - Step 2: responding an error message to the user if Step 1 fails.

    ```

        #         response

1. Evaluate the LLM's answer to the user with a rubric based on the extracted product information

* Input: cust_prod_info and assistant_answer
* Output: evaluation_output

2. Evaluate the LLM's answer to the user based on an "ideal" / "expert" (human generated) answer
    2.1 Normal assistant answer
       * Input: assistant_answer - normal and test_set_ideal
       * Output: eval_vs_ideal
    2.2 Abnormal assistant answer
       * Input: assistant_answer2 - abnormal and test_set_ideal
